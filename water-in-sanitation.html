        <h1>WATER IN SANITATION</h1>
        <p>
          Water is vital for preventing people coming into contact with disease. It may not be obvious to some, but access to water (even with soap) is needed for a washroom facility to be sanitary and safe. The flow of water in bathroom facilities carries away germs that have been left behind in sinks and toilets. The water then flows into other facilities where a contamination process occurs. This has prevented many spaces from becoming heavily contaminated by dangerous germs. In more rural and low-income areas, people often walk long distances to access washroom facilities that use water. While proper infrastructure also helps with maintaining hygiene, water plays a key role in doing so.
