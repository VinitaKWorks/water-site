        <h1>ORIGINS OF FRESHWATER</h1>  
        <p>The kind of water that humans use is very rare. A lot of times people do not remember that most of the water available is saltwater. This is most commonly seen in oceans. Occasionally saltwater from the oceans can be desalinated for human consumption. However, a large portion of freshwater (which is most of the water people drink) comes from underground. Due to climate change, freshwater is more often recycled these days for continual consumption.
