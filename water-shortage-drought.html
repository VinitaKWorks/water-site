        <h1>WATER SHORTAGE AND DROUGHT</h1> 
        <p>A period of dry climate with little to no precipitation is referred to as a drought. While not every drought results in lack of water in a region, scarcity is still possible. In the last five to ten years, most droughts occurred in areas that were generally warm in temperature. Hotspots for droughts include Western U.S., Southern Australia, and Northeastern Brazil. Due to climate change and the constant use of water, the world is now at risk for more drought hotspots than it was before.
